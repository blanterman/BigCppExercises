And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain,
Thrilled me filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before.
So that now to steal the beating of my heart I stood repeating 
"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door
some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door. This it is and nothing more."
