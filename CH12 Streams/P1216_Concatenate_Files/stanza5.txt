Deep into that darkness peering. Long I stood there wondering fearing
Doubting dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before.
But the silence was unbroken and the darkness gave no token
And the only word there spoken was the wispered word, "Lenore."
This I whispered and and echo murmured back the word, "Lenore." Merely this and nothing more.
