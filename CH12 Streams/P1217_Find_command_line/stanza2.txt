Aw distinctly I remember it was in the bleak december,
And each seperate dying ember wraught its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow, vaily I had saught to borrow,
From my books surcease of sorrow, sorrow for the lost lenore.
For the rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels name lenore, nameless here forever more.
