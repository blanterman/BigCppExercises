Presently my sould grew stronger hesitating then no longer
"Sir," said I. "Or madam surely your forgiveness I implore.
But the fact is I was napping when so faintly you came tapping
and so faintly you came rapping, rapping at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you." Here I opened wide the door. Darkness there and nothing more.
