Back into my chamber turning, all my soul within me burning
soon I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
"Surely," said I "Surely that is something at my window lattice
Let me see then what there at is and this mytery explore.
Let my heart be still a minute and this mystery explore. Tis the wind and nothing more."
