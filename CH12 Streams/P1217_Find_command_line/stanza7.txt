Open here I flung the shutter then with many a flirt and flutter
In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore. 
Not the least obiescience made he. Not a moment stopped or stayed he
but with mein of lord or lady perched upon my chamber door.
Perched upon a bust of Pallace just above my chamber door. Perched and sat and nothing more.
